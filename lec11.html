    </div>

 

    <h3 class="eskills">Negotiation skills have taught me the power of effective communication and the importance of finding balance in conflicting interests. I’ve learned to approach discussions with preparation and empathy, listening actively to understand the needs and concerns of others. These skills have equipped me with the ability to articulate my viewpoints clearly, navigate challenging situations with composure, and find solutions that create value for everyone involved.

        Through the art of compromise and collaboration, I’ve discovered that negotiation is not just about winning—it’s about building trust,
         fostering relationships, and achieving outcomes that benefit all parties. This understanding has reshaped the way I approach both personal
          and professional challenges.</h3>

          <h3 class="eskills">Activity 1  (Negotiation Roleplay – Hotel Manager vs. Client)</h3>
          <p>In this interactive activity, participants roleplay a negotiation scenario involving a hotel manager and a client from ABC Company.
             The client aims to organize a company event at the hotel and negotiate a lower price for food plates and overall event costs.

                 emotional control, and adaptability in achieving win-win outcomes. Participants gain practical experience in
                  handling challenges, fostering trust, and finding common ground in business discussions.</p>
